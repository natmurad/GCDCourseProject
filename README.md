This code downloads and reads the datasets.
It merges the datasets (train and test data) in a unique dataset.
Then it calculates the mean and standard deviation for each variable.
Each variable is storaged in a column.
So, it creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
